# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## Objective
Mobile development requires more computational resources than web development.  
To simplify the process, this setup uses the **Expo Framework** for **React Native**, which allows testing and building mobile apps efficiently.

## Requirements
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js (LTS version)**
- **VS Code** (recommended IDE)
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows
- **Expo Go** app on your mobile device (Android or iOS)

## Why Expo Go?
Traditional mobile development requires emulators that consume significant system resources.  
Expo Go offers a cost-effective and lightweight alternative by allowing developers to run and test their React Native apps directly on physical devices.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Node.js
Download and install the LTS version from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).  
Verify installation:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
